<p>Earlier this year, Triple Canopy celebrated the tenth anniversary of its first issue, “The Medium Was Tedium.” In the ensuing ten years and twenty-five issues, the magazine has explored different conceptual frameworks and developed publishing systems that have operated with (and against) shiftings forms of contemporary networked cultural production, circulation, and reception. As a magazine, Triple Canopy is dedicated to sustained inquiry, careful reading and viewing, resisting and expanding the present. In “The Binder and the Server,” a memoir-manifesto published in 2010, we proclaimed our intention to “slow down the internet”; later, in recognition of the erosion of the line between “online” and “offline,” we pivoted to “slow down the world.” These aims have been reflected in our interfaces and organizational paradigms, which have encouraged prolonged, focused engagement, and extends to our collaborative methods with the contributors to the magazine. In his lecture at ODD, Caleb Waldorf, co-founder and creative director of Triple Canopy, will trace the past, present, and future of Triple Canopy’s approach to post-digital publishing as well as how the magazine is situated within a broader field of publication topologies.</p>

<h2 id="b-ber-workshop">b-ber Workshop</h2>

<p>In the Winter of 2019, Triple Canopy will release an open-source tool called b-ber that can publish an array of formats—ePubs, mobis, websites, PDFs, and XML files—that are generated from documents written in an extended version of Markdown (based off the ePub3 semantic vocabulary). b-ber’s approach to authoring, editing, and publishing, engenders the possibility for multiple actors—writers, editors, designers, technologists, and machines—to better understand, parse, and collaborate on a given work. b-ber also shifts the focus from print-first, with digital formats as an afterthought (or not considered at all), towards understanding publication formats as mutable and branches off a single source. In the workshop at ODD, Caleb Waldorf will explain the underlying concept of b-ber and demo its capacity and uses. We will also have the opportunity to make some publications together.</p>
