On November 7, Triple Canopy presented Print & Demand #2, the second in an ongoing series of conversations exploring how print culture is being changed by the manifold forms of online publication and how public spaces are being constituted around those forms. The discussion, which took place at The NY Art Book Fair at MoMA PS1, included James Goggin, Jiminie Ha, and Rob Giampietro, and was moderated by Triple Canopy creative director Caleb Waldorf. It focused on the role played by design in shaping digital forms of publication: How are certain tropes of print publication—and the reading and viewing experiences they have engendered—being translated for new media (while others are being jettisoned entirely)? How has the shift from graphic design to user design, with its focus on interaction and interface, changed the way publications function?
