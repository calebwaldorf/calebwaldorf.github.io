I'll be participating in the "SNOWDEN FILES FOR ALL?" workshop at the [UN COMMONS](http://berlinergazette.de/uncommons/) program. 

Workshop on October 22+23, 10 a.m.–6 p.m. and on October 24, 10–12 a.m.  
Volksbühne at Rosa-Luxemburg Platz. 

Description:

>SNOWDEN FILES FOR ALL?  
>The Snowden revelations have caused a global debate. Yet, what does it mean to handle the documents in a responsible manner? How can we preserve them in accessible and sustainable ways? How can the leaks become public record? The workshop “Snowden Files For All?” discusses hands on approaches and develops a position paper for a collaborative approach to this challenge.

>Workshop guests include Diani Barreto (Courage Foundation), Branka Curcic (Kuda.org), Kristoffer Gansing (transmediale), Evan Light (Portable Snowden Surveillance Archive), Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen (Kritische Bibliothek), Diana McCarty (reboot.fm), Morana Miljanovic (Hertie School of Governance), André Rebentisch (meshcon.net), Maria Tengarrinha (O Espelho), Caleb Waldorf (apubliclibrary.org). Moderators: Sabrina Apitz (berlinergazette.de) + Corinna Haas (ICI Library).
