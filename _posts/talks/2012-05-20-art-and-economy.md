KW ArtWiki Room

With Maria Byk, Stefan Heidenreich, Matteo Pasquinelli, Caleb Waldorf, Joanna Warsza
moderated by Pit Schultz

The artist as a role model for the creative industry marks a transformation of the field of artistic production from the creation
of auratic originals to the heterogenic strategies of applied arts, speculatory self-management, and a bluring of domains and skills. how does the art market relate to the larger economy? which role do digital commons, internet and copyright play? how should public institutions legitimize within a market driven paradigm? the guests will discuss in a open coffee table situation, where visitors can join on site, on air, and online. twitter: @rebootfm
