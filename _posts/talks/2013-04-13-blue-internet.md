I just returned from NYC where I participated in a 2-day internal MoMA seminar hosted by C-MAP on the theme of global networks and the new platform that just launched: **[post](http://post.at.moma.org/about)**. In addition to the C-MAP team, participants included Ana Longoni, Zdenka Badovinac, Claire Hsu and myself along with C-MAP's counselors Homi Bhabha, David Joselit and Mieke Bal.
