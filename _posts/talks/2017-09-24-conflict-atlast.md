I had a conversation with Jasmijn Visser for the book launch of her recently published [*Conflict Atlas: Geopolitics and Contingencies on the Malvinas-Falklands Archipelago*](http://www.archivebooks.org/2017/03/16/conflict-atlasgeopolitics-and-contingencies-on-the-malvinas-falklands-archipelagojasmijn-visser/) (Archive Books, 2017) as part of the [Friends with Books](http://www.friendswithbooks.org/) fair at the Hamburger Bahnhof.
