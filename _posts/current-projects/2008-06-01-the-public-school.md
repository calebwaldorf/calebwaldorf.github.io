In 2007, The Public School was initiated in Los Angeles in the basement of [Telic Arts Exchange](http://telic.info). The Public School is a school with no curriculum. It is not accredited, it does not give out degrees, and it has no affiliation with the public school system. It is a framework that supports autodidactic activities, operating under the assumption that everything is in everything.
