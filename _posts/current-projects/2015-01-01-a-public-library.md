A Public Library is not a public library. It is a space for conversations, presentations, the sharing of resources, and for collective reading, viewing, and learning. It hosts an ephemeral collection of publications and other materials, which will provide a foundation for, and expand along with, a series of public programs, workshops, and classes organized in conjunction with The Public School Berlin as well as other collaborators.

A Public Library is currently located at the Bona-Peiser-Bibliothek in Berlin Kreuzberg (Oranienstraße 72, 10969) and is accessible on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons.

A Public Library is organized by [Fiona Geuß](http://www.fionageuss.net/), [Fotini Lazaridou-Hatzigoga](http://www.otherspaces.net/) and Caleb Waldorf.
