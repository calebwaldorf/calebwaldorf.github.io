A Public Library is not a public library. It is a space for conversations, presentations, the sharing of resources, and for collective reading, viewing, and learning. It hosts an ephemeral collection of publications and other materials, which will provide a foundation for, and expand along with, a series of public programs, workshops, and classes organized in conjunction with [The Public School Berlin](http://berlin.thepublicschool.org) as well as other collaborators.

From January through December 2015, A Public Library was located at the Bona-Peiser-Bibliothek in Berlin Kreuzberg. 

A Public Library is organized by [Fiona Geu√ü](http://www.fionageuss.net/), [Fotini Lazaridou-Hatzigoga](http://www.otherspaces.net/) and Caleb Waldorf.
